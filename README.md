## Team IPT
Team IPT consists of [Matth√§us Heer](https://ipt.ch/de/team/mitarbeiter/matthaus-heer), [Nicolas Mesot](https://ipt.ch/de/team/mitarbeiter/nicolas-mesot) and [Max Riedel](https://ipt.ch/de/team/mitarbeiter/max-riedel). We all are IT Consultants with [Innovation Process Technology AG](https://ipt.ch) in Zurich, Switzerland.

## Requirements
The following overview exhibits all actors participating in the system with their main intentions and capabilities.
More specifics can be found in the functional requirements section below.

We grouped the requirements for the **Hey, Blue!** application into the following two sections.  
- [Functional requirements](requirements/functional-requirements.md)
- [Non-functional requirements](requirements/non-functional-requirements.md)  

While the former explains the desired functionalities of the application, describing possible user interactions, the former
represents a set of technical guidelines the system has to adhere to.

## Context
In the following we will describe what actors (can be a user, participant or system) might interact in what way with the **Hey, Blue!** system.
For that matter, the diagram displays the main capabilities or intentions a user or system has to its disposal. 

The actors are being divided into internal, i.e. actors which are internal to the **Hey, Blue!** ecosystem and external actors,
e.g., civilians and officers using the application. That way we receive a clear picture who profits from this ecosystem
and what the intends and desires of those actors might be.
