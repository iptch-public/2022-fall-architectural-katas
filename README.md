## Team IPT
Team IPT consists of [Matth√§us Heer](https://ipt.ch/de/team/mitarbeiter/matthaus-heer), [Nicolas Mesot](https://ipt.ch/de/team/mitarbeiter/nicolas-mesot) and [Max Riedel](https://ipt.ch/de/team/mitarbeiter/max-riedel). We all are IT Consultants with [Innovation Process Technology AG](https://ipt.ch) in Zurich, Switzerland.

## Requirements
The following overview exhibits all actors participating in the system with their main intentions and capabilities.
More specifics can be found in the functional requirements section below.

</p>

We grouped the requirements for the **Hey, Blue!** application into the following two sections.  
- [Functional requirements](requirements/functional-requirements.md)
- [Non-functional requirements](requirements/non-functional-requirements.md)  

While the former explains the desired functionalities of the application, describing possible user interactions, the former
represents a set of technical guidelines the system has to adhere to.

## Context
In the following we will describe what actors (can be a user, participant or system) might interact in what way with the **Hey, Blue!** system.
For that matter, the diagram displays the main capabilities or intentions a user or system has to its disposal. 

The actors are being divided into internal, i.e. actors which are internal to the **Hey, Blue!** ecosystem and external actors,
e.g., civilians and officers using the application. That way we receive a clear picture who profits from this ecosystem
and what the intends and desires of those actors might be.
