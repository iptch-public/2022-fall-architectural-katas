## Additional functionality

### Virtual Connections
Beta testing of **Hey, Blue!** brought up the issue that there are Police Officers willing to participate in the system but not willing to share their location. This may be for privacy or safety reasons. We propose the additional functionality of *Virtual Connections* to handle those cases.

Officers, that are not willing to share their location, can login and register for *OfficerLookup*. After that, Civilians are able to find those Officers via a list in their app. They can then propose a connection which can be accepted by the officer. From this moment the connection is treated equally to a proximity connection. It is rewared with a Point and can be shared to Social Media.

### Comprehensive Reporting and Analytics

Web and Mobile-Based with back-end processing and reporting and analytics for distribution to various media companies. Reports will be shared on a daily/weekly/monthly basis.
