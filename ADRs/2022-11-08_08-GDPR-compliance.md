# 2022-11-08 ADR08 GDPR Compliance

## Title
GDPR compliance for all user data

## Status
Proposed

## Context
User data compliance is a complex topic. In the US, every state imposes their own restrictions and regulations. Large 
companies can afford to develop different solutions for each jurisdiction. We are of the opinion that **Hey, blue!** can use
their limited resources more efficiently than developing a different solution for each jurisdiction.

## Decision
GDPR has established itself as the gold standard for user data privacy and protection. While the up-front cost of 
implementing a GDPR-compliant solution is slightly higher, we believe that a one-size-fits-all solution will pay off
in the long run. This not only eliminated the headache in dealing with different US-state jurisdictions but also
future-proofs the app for an expansion overseas.

We also believe that user data privacy and protection is paramount, and GDPR offers the best guarantees in this regard.
As a non-profit organization, user trust is everything. This decision is a big step in the right direction.

## Consequences
Moderate up-front cost, big potential savings down the road.
